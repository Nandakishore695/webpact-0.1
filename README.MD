Webpack.config.js File for javascript bundling: -
const path = require('path');
module.exports = {
  mode: 'development', // or 'production'
  entry: './src/js/app.js',

    filename: 'main.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),

Loaders allow us to transform our files.
Webpack.config.js File for css bundling: -
module: {
    rules:[
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [
          'style-loader',
          'css-loader'
        ]

    ]
  },
